# Pages

An example of building a server/client relationship using [gRPC][1] and [protocol
buffers][2]. In this example the server is written in Go along with a very simple
command line client. The web client is written in [Elm][3] which uses the [gRPC
Gateway][4] interface. And finally the native client is written in Swift using
the new [swift-protobuf][5] library.

:warning: This is incomplete. The Swift client and server should build.

## Run server

    $ ./setup.sh
    $ make
    $ cd server && go run main.go
